# WoWs Info
This is an unofficial app for the game [World of Warships](https://worldofwarships.com/). Its predecessor is [WoWs Info Swift](https://github.com/HenryQuan/WoWs_Info_Swift) but it is only available on IOS. This project aims to build a cross platform version of WoWs Info for IOS, Android, Windows 10 (and maybe Mac OS).

## Features
* [ ] Search players and clans
  - [ ] Detailed statistics
  - [ ] [Personal Rating](https://wows-numbers.com/personal/rating)
* [x] Get lastest news
* [x] Wiki for World of Warships
  - [ ] Stats for all warships
* [ ] Your own player list
  - [ ] Star your friends and good players
  - [x] I am glad to play in a division
* [x] Check how many online players are online
* [x] Support all major servers
  - [ ] ASIA, EU, RU, NA (and maybe CN)
* [ ] Free and open source (but there is an IAP)
  - [ ] Windows 10 version is not free (but no IAP)
  - [ ] There might be a Mac version
* [x] Theme (probably in the following updates)

Data will be saved locally for better performance and this project should be more stable than WoWs Info Swift. (However, I found out that some Android devices could not save data to its storage and I have not found any solutions yet)

<p style="color:transparent;">I used to love this game so much and I decided to do something for it. However, things are changing so rapidly. This is still a good game but it still has serious problems as a 2-year-old game. At least for me, nerf a ship heavily is the worst decision ever. I started playing this game for a single ship and you nerfed it... Why do I still need to love this game? Japanese DD is just not balanced. I am waiting for it, World of Warships. I still believe in you and that's why I am making this app. Please understand 2017.12.17</p>
